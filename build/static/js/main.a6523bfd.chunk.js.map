farm, after a detour to the world of radio and night. Passionate about music, he worked for 10 years in the organization of concerts and as DJ in the discotheques. At thirty he returned to the land to perpetuate the work of his grandparents and his father Michel who was one of the first to believe in the supremacy of Chardonnay in Chitry. Chitry is as close as you can get to Chablis and the soils here are the same kimmeridgian chalky series which is shown in the flinty minerality of the wines. Olivier Morin invested in a semi-underground winery, which allows working by gravity, reducing the pumping and crushing wine.

Each cru is vinified separately, with no malolactic fermentation, and the two rackings are done by gravity. Krug Grande Cuvee is born from the dream of one man, Joseph Krug, to offer the very best Champagne every single year, regardless of annual variations in climate. Every year since 1843, the House of Krug has honored this dream with a new Edition of Krug Grande Cuvee: the fullest expression of Champagne. Its exceptional finesse is the result of a stay of around seven years in the cellars. The 166the edition is composed of 140 wines from 13 different harvests between 1998 and 2010.

From his earliest youth Vincent had a passion for working with vines, and great respect for the potential that they represent and was always ambitious to produce his own wine. The quality of his wines was quickly recognized by connoisseurs all over the world, and this enabled him to expand his activity, focusing primarily on the great white and red wines of the Côte de Beaune. In the years between 1980 and 1990 his passion and curiosity led him to try all of the techniques that were being employed at that time. It was only in the early 2000s with the arrival of Eric Germain as winemaker, that a profound change began to take place. They decided to concentrate on the essence of the wines: the expression of the great terroirs of Burgundy. A new purity of style was born, which has now been acknowledged by all winemakers. The Cuvee Saint-Vincent comes mostly from 45 year old vines around the Cote de Beaune.

Other than World War II, when the Germans occupied the country and Chateau de Breze, the Breze family has owned, and continues to own, the chateau. The château is not only a UNESCO World Heritage site, but the wines were regularly exchanged by the royals for Sauternes’ greatest, Château d’Yquem. When the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) of Saumur-Champigny was established in 1957, the owner of Château de Brézé refused the inclusion of his vineyards into this red wine appellation. His claim was that his historical vineyards were the best in the area and that they should have their own AOC, Brézé.  He was denied and the vineyards became part of Saumur. In 2009, the château’s new owner, le Comte de Colbert, asked Yves Lambert and his son, Arnaud to control the winery. They accepted and immediately began converting these historical vineyards to organic after more than fifty years of chemical farming.

Even today, the site still has buildings which date back to this monastic past. There is no doubt that it has some of the most wonderful views in Burgundy. The lost hamlet of Blagny, up in the hills between Puligny-Montrachet and Meursault in the Côte d'Or in Burgundy, is home to Domaine Comtesse de Chérisey. Monks were the first inhabitants, planting vines in the 14th century. This almost magical, lost-in-time corner of the world boasts a unique microclimate, with a slightly different average temperature, exposition and soil than the rest of Burgundy. All of the de Chérisey premier cru vines are at least 60 years old and they encircle their ancient cellar in the Hameau de Blagny. The Meursault-Blagny 1er Cru La Genelotte is from a vineyard just north of Blagny, on the Meursault side of course, high on the slope above the village. The wine is a powerful, classic, long-lived Meursault. The Genelotte vineyard is also a monopole meaning Laurent and Hélène are sole proprietors. \",\r\n    mise: \"BURG\",\r\n    price: \"38\",\r\n    color: \"white\",\r\n    status: \"none\",\r\n    description1: \"Apple Pie\",\r\n    description2: \" Pineapple\",\r\n    description3: \" Guava\",\r\n    description4: \" Ripe Melon\",\r\n    description5: \" Toast\",\r\n    description6: \" Caramel\",\r\n    description7: \" Vanilla\",\r\n    description8: \" Brioche\",\r\n    description9: \" Almonds\",\r\n    description10: \" Hazelnuts\",\r\n    description11: \" Chamomile\",\r\n    description12: \" Wet Rocks\",\r\n    description13: \" Limestone\",\r\n    description14: \" Sulphur\",\r\n    coravin: true,\r\n    // color: \"corovan\",\r\n    grapes: \"Chardonnay\",\r\n    grape1: \"Chardonnay\",\r\n    grape2: \"\",\r\n    grape3: \"\",\r\n    grape4: \"\",\r\n    FIELD30: \"\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    _id: \"5da7731a36ae24c5609ca4fd\",\r\n    name: \"Domaine Guy Castagnier Charmes Chambertain Grand Cru\",\r\n    year: \"1989\",\r\n    place: \"Cote de Nuits, Burgundy, FR\",\r\n    appellation: \"Charmes-Chambertain Grand Cru\",\r\n    funfact:\r\n      \"Jérôme Castagnier is fifth generation to run the family estate.

While the blend varies from vintage to vintage, typically it is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with roughly equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot and a touch of Petit Verdot. Les Pavots captures an elegant refined expression of the terroir embracing the full spectrum of Cabernet family varietal expression with its trademark touch of herbes de provence. The name translates to “The Poppies” and is named after the California poppies that grow wild on our estate and are the inspiration for the winery’s logo.\",\r\n    mise: \"BDX\",\r\n    price: \"89\",\r\n    color: \"red\",\r\n    status: \"none\",\r\n    description1: \"Blackberry\",\r\n    description2: \" Blueberry Pie\",\r\n    description3: \" Cassis Liqueur\",\r\n    description4: \" Herbaceous\",\r\n    description5: \" Graphite\",\r\n    description6: \" Savory Meats\",\r\n    description7: \" Vanilla\",\r\n    description8: \" Cedar\",\r\n    description9: \" Smoke\",\r\n    description10: \" Balanced\",\r\n    description11: \"\",\r\n    description12: \"\",\r\n    description13: \"\",\r\n    description14: \"\",\r\n    coravin: true,\r\n    // color: \"corovan\",\r\n    grapes:\r\n      \"60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc 13% Merlot 2% Petite Verdot\",\r\n    grape1: \"Cabernet Sauvignon\",\r\n    grape2: \"Cabernet Franc\",\r\n    grape3: \"Merlot\",\r\n    grape4: \"Petite Verdot\",\r\n    FIELD30: \"\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    _id: \"5da7731a36ae24c5609ca508\",\r\n    name: \"Chateau d'Armailhac 5th Growth (dee-arm-ail-ack)\",\r\n    year: \"2010\",\r\n    place: \"Bordeaux, FR\",\r\n    appellation: \"Paulliac\",\r\n    funfact:\r\n      \"A local register from 1680 notes the existence of two brothers, Dominique et Guilhem Armailhacq, who own parcels of land in Pauillac.

He acquired his first parcel, 1.2 hectares of En Chailloux, and began to vinify under his own label in the 1982 vintage.
