winemaker in the village of St Andelain in Pouilly-Fumé. As someone who always liked to push the limits, Didier left his home town at a young age to race motorcycle side cars on the international circuit between 1978 and 1982. He later added dog-sled racing to his list of passions, and here too, competed internationally for many years during the winter months. Dagueneau returned to the his native village in 1982 and in typical Didier fashion, elected to set up his own estate in Pouilly-Fumé rather than join the family fold. Inspired by the great wines of Burgundy and other top regions (his mentors were Edmond Vatan and Henri Jayer) and emboldened by the wisdom and traditions of his grandfather, Louis Dagueneau, he set about to create a Pouilly-Fumé of extraordinary dimension and terroir focus exploiting the top vineyard sites around St. Andelain. He acquired his first parcel, 1.2 hectares of En Chailloux, and began to vinify under his own label in the 1982 vintage. In 1985, he added the now infamous Silex, and in 1988, Pur Sang.\",\r\n    mise: \"DW\",\r\n    price: 86,\r\n    color: \"dessert\",\r\n    status: \"none\",\r\n    description1: \"Peach\",\r\n    description2: \"Apricot\",\r\n    description3: \"Orange Blossom\",\r\n    description4: \"Lemon Zest\",\r\n    description5: \"Grand Marnier\",\r\n    description6: \"Marzipan\",\r\n    description7: \"Caramel\",\r\n    description8: \"Rosewater\",\r\n    description9: \"Honey\",\r\n    description10: \"Vanilla\",\r\n    description11: \"\",\r\n    description12: \"\",\r\n    description13: \"\",\r\n    description14: \"\",\r\n    coravin: true,\r\n    grapes: \"Petit Manseng\",\r\n    grape1: \"Petit Manseng\",\r\n    grape2: \"\",\r\n    grape3: \"\",\r\n    grape4: \"\",\r\n\r\n    area: \"Southwest France\",\r\n    country: \"France\",\r\n    lastUpdated: \"2019-11-19T22:09:59.074Z\",\r\n    picture: \"jardins\",\r\n    vinyard: \"Didier Dagueneau\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    _id: \"5da7731a36ae24c5609ca4dd\",\r\n    name: \"Dissident\",\r\n    year: \"2017\",\r\n    place: \"\",\r\n    appellation: \"Columbia Valley\",\r\n    funfact:\r\n      \"Mostly from Red Mountain, this wine is sourced from Quintessence, Ciel du Cheval, Klipsun, and Obelisco, as well as Phinny Hill in Horse Heaven Hills and Red Willow in the Yakima Valley.

As they drove near the Oregon/Washington border, he spied an open field littered with acres of softball-sized stones. Plans to move to the Willamette Valley were quickly discarded, and Christophe resolved to buy the property and plant a vineyard. He saw something different with enormous potential. The terroir reminded him of the cobblestones of the southern Rhone valley and Châteuneuf-du-Pape in his native France. “I almost fell on my derrière when I saw those stones,” he says. “And I've been living the dream ever since.” \",\r\n    mise: \"BDX\",\r\n    price: 97,\r\n    color: \"red\",\r\n    status: \"none\",\r\n    description1: \"Dark Berries\",\r\n    description2: \"Gunflint\",\r\n    description3: \"Smoked Meats\",\r\n    description4: \"Lilacs\",\r\n    description5: \"Salt\",\r\n    description6: \"Tangerine Skins\",\r\n    description7: \"Leather\",\r\n    description8: \"Horse Hide\",\r\n    description9: \"Exotic Spice\",\r\n    description10: \"\",\r\n    description11: \"\",\r\n    description12: \"\",\r\n    description13: \"\",\r\n    description14: \"\",\r\n    coravin: true,\r\n    grapes: \"100% Syrah\",\r\n    grape1: \"Syrah\",\r\n    grape2: \"\",\r\n    grape3: \"\",\r\n    grape4: \"\",\r\n\r\n    area: \"Washington\",\r\n    country: \"USA\",\r\n    lastUpdated: \"2019-11-19T22:23:27.325Z\",\r\n    picture: \"cayusa\",\r\n    vinyard: \"Cayuse\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    _id: \"5da7731a36ae24c5609ca507\",\r\n    name:\r\n      \"Cabernet Sauvignon ‘les Pavots’ Knights Valley, Sonoma County (lay Pav-Ohh)\",\r\n    year: \"2014\",\r\n    place: \"Sonoma County\",\r\n    appellation: \"Knights Valley\",\r\n    funfact:\r\n      \"In 1982, after a six year search, Sir Peter Michael and Lady Michael purchased 630 acres of volcanic ridges on the western face of Mount St. Helena in Knights Valley.

The site is an ancient riverbed composed of cobble and rocks interwoven with pockets of tufa (volcanic ash) that were uplifted during the last volcanic activity in the area.

Each cru is vinified separately, with no malolactic fermentation, and the two rackings are done by gravity. Krug Grande Cuvee is born from the dream of one man, Joseph Krug, to offer the very best Champagne every single year, regardless of annual variations in climate. Every year since 1843, the House of Krug has honored this dream with a new Edition of Krug Grande Cuvee: the fullest expression of Champagne. Its exceptional finesse is the result of a stay of around seven years in the cellars. The 166the edition is composed of 140 wines from 13 different harvests between 1998 and 2010. This wine is 58% from the base year of 2010, but fully 42% of the cuvée is composed of reserve wines, with disgorgement done in the winter of 2017.

Florian is a minimalist in their cellar in the village of Ayl. The only interventions are temperature control and a clarification prior to fermentation and battonage. Spontaneous fermentation and lees contact are the norm here. The Barrel X is a playful exception to the single site rule - a blend of parcels within the Saar from Ayler Kupp and a few parcels farmed by friends.

Aged in oak for 31 months, the goal was to push the wine to a more Gran Reserva style similar to Rioja. Gran Reserva's are 2 years oak and 3 in bottle. Only 125 cases of this wine were ever made. \",\r\n    mise: \"AP\",\r\n    price: 19,\r\n    color: \"red\",\r\n    status: \"removed\",\r\n    description1: \"Red Cherries\",\r\n    description2: \"Baked Raspberry\",\r\n    description3: \"Pencil Lead\",\r\n    description4: \"Bark\",\r\n    description5: \"Smoke\",\r\n    description6: \"Espresso\",\r\n    description7: \"Vanilla\",\r\n    description8: \"Nutmeg\",\r\n    description9: \"\",\r\n    description10: \"\",\r\n    description11: \"\",\r\n    description12: \"\",\r\n    description13: \"\",\r\n    description14: \"\",\r\n    coravin: false,\r\n    grapes: \"Tempranillo\",\r\n    grape1: \"Tempranillo\",\r\n    grape2: \"\",\r\n    grape3: \"\",\r\n    grape4: \"\",\r\n\r\n    area: \"Washington\",\r\n    country: \"USA\",\r\n    lastUpdated: \"2019-11-19T21:30:18.730Z\",\r\n    picture: null,\r\n    vinyard: \"Kerloo Cellars\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    _id: \"5da7731a36ae24c5609ca4e0\",\r\n    name: \"Kerloo Cellars\",\r\n    year: \"2017\",\r\n    place: \"\",\r\n    appellation: \"Columbia Valley\",\r\n    funfact:\r\n      \"This is Ryan's first time ever sourcing Cabernet Sauvignon from the coveted Red Willow Vineyard. 69% New French Oak with 69% of the fruit coming form the Red Willow Vineyard, and the rest from Bacchus Old Block. \",\r\n    mise: \"AP\",\r\n    price: 18,\r\n    color: \"red\",\r\n    status: \"added\",\r\n    description1: \"Black Cherries\",\r\n    description2: \"Currants\",\r\n    description3: \"Red Plum\",\r\n    description4: \"Clove\",\r\n    description5: \"Allspice\",\r\n    description6: \"Roasted Bell Peppers\",\r\n    description7: \"Graphite\",\r\n    description8: \"Mulch\",\r\n    description9: \"\",\r\n    description10: \"\",\r\n    description11: \"\",\r\n    description12: \"\",\r\n    description13: \"\",\r\n    description14: \"\",\r\n    coravin: false,\r\n    grapes: \"100% Cabernet Sauvignon \",\r\n    grape1: \"Cabernet Sauvignon \",\r\n    grape2: \"\",\r\n    grape3: \"\",\r\n    grape4: \"\",\r\n\r\n    area: \"Washington\",\r\n    country: \"USA\",\r\n    lastUpdated: \"2019-11-19T21:31:18.594Z\",\r\n    picture: null,\r\n    vinyard: \"Kerloo Cellars\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    _id: \"5da7731a36ae24c5609ca4e1\",\r\n    name: \"'Les Collines' Vineyard\",\r\n    year: \"2013\",\r\n    place: \"\",\r\n    appellation: \"Walla Walla\",\r\n    funfact:\r\n      \"The soil at Les Collines Vineyard consists of mostly Walla Walla Silt Loam, with some Athena Silt Loam resting on top of ancient gravel.

From his earliest youth Vincent had a passion for working with vines, and great respect for the potential that they represent and was always ambitious to produce his own wine. The quality of his wines was quickly recognized by connoisseurs all over the world, and this enabled him to expand his activity, focusing primarily on the great white and red wines of the Côte de Beaune. In the years between 1980 and 1990 his passion and curiosity led him to try all of the techniques that were being employed at that time. It was only in the early 2000s with the arrival of Eric Germain as winemaker, that a profound change began to take place. They decided to concentrate on the essence of the wines: the expression of the great terroirs of Burgundy. A new purity of style was born, which has now been acknowledged by all winemakers. The Cuvee Saint-Vincent comes mostly from 45 year old vines around the Cote de Beaune. It is aged in 500L barrels (10% new)  for 10 months and blended only on fruit days according to the biodynamic calendar. \",\r\n    mise: \"AP\",\r\n    price: 16,\r\n    color: \"red\",\r\n    status: \"removed\",\r\n    description1: \"Cranberry\",\r\n    description2: \"Raspberry\",\r\n    description3: \"Red Cherries\",\r\n    description4: \"Potting Soil\",\r\n    description5: \"Mushrooms\",\r\n    description6: \"Soy Sauce\",\r\n    description7: \"Tea Leaves\",\r\n    description8: \"Sandalwood\",\r\n    description9: \"\",\r\n    description10: \"\",\r\n    description11: \"\",\r\n    description12: \"\",\r\n    description13: \"\",\r\n    description14: \"\",\r\n    coravin: false,\r\n    grapes: \"Pinot Noir\",\r\n    grape1: \"Pinot Noir\",\r\n    grape2: \"\",\r\n    grape3: \"\",\r\n    grape4: \"\",\r\n\r\n    area: \"Burgundy\",\r\n    country: \"France\",\r\n    lastUpdated: \"2019-11-19T21:34:47.010Z\",\r\n    picture: null,\r\n    vinyard: \"Domaine Vincent Girardin\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    _id: \"5da7731a36ae24c5609ca4e4\",\r\n    name: \"Crowley Wines Pinot Noir\",\r\n    year: \"2017\",\r\n    place: \"\",\r\n    appellation: \"Willamette Valley\",\r\n    funfact:\r\n      \"Tyson crowley founded his eponymous winery with the goal to make transparent and terroir driven wines.

His claim was that his historical vineyards were the best in the area and that they should have their own AOC, Brézé.  He was denied and the vineyards became part of Saumur. In 2009, the château’s new owner, le Comte de Colbert, asked Yves Lambert and his son, Arnaud to control the winery.

They bottle this low-alcohol wine using the méthode ancestrale, a rare technique that experts believe predates the méthode champenoise. The wine first goes through a primary fermentation in cuve, but is then bottled before all of the residual sugar has converted to alcohol. After going through a secondary fermentation in the bottle for at least two months, the wine is ready—Champagne’s dosage is not permitted! The resulting wine is delightfully refreshing with bright fruit, a beautiful rosé hue, and a touch of sweetness.\",\r\n    mise: \"Flute\",\r\n    price: 14,\r\n    color: \"dessert\",\r\n    status: \"none\",\r\n    description1: \"Candied Strawberries\",\r\n    description2: \"Cranberries\",\r\n    description3: \"Rhubarb\",\r\n    description4: \"Cider\",\r\n    description5: \"Mulling Spices\",\r\n    description6: \"Orange Blossoms\",\r\n    description7: \"Rocky Minerality\",\r\n    description8: \"\",\r\n    description9: \"\",\r\n    description10: \"\",\r\n    description11: \"\",\r\n    description12: \"\",\r\n    description13: \"\",\r\n    description14: \"\",\r\n    coravin: false,\r\n    grapes: \"80% Gamay, 20% Poulsard\",\r\n    grape1: \"Gamay\",\r\n    grape2: \"Poulsard\",\r\n    grape3: \"\",\r\n    grape4: \"\",\r\n\r\n    area: \"Savoie\",\r\n    country: \"France\",\r\n    lastUpdated: \"2019-11-19T21:45:40.555Z\",\r\n    picture: null,\r\n    vinyard: \"Patrick Bottex \"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    _id: \"5da7731a36ae24c5609ca4eb\",\r\n    name: \"5 Puttonyos (royal to-KYE, os-SUE, five put-TOON-yosh)\",\r\n    year: \"2013\",\r\n    place: \"\",\r\n    appellation: \"Tokaj\",\r\n    funfact:\r\n      'Royal Tokaj Wine Company was founded by wine author Hugh Johnson after fall of Communist block.

Chris Blandy, the family’s 7th generation member to work in the company states, “Whilst the family’s cellars were fortunate enough to have benefited from the foresight of my ancestor Charles Ridpath, our focus today continues to be on aging and producing these fine vintage Madeiras.” The exceptional 1985 Malmsey (bottled in 2009) is a case in point, in 2010 having won the Madeira Trophy at the International Wine Challenge and the Fortified Wine Trophy at the International Wine and Spirit competition.”\",\r\n    mise: \"DW\",\r\n    price: 76,\r\n    color: \"dessert\",\r\n    status: \"none\",\r\n    description1: \"Toffee\",\r\n    description2: \"Butterscotch\",\r\n    description3: \"white chocolate\",\r\n    description4: \"Wildflower Honey\",\r\n    description5: \"Flamed Orange Peel\",\r\n    description6: \"Cedar\",\r\n    description7: \"\",\r\n    description8: \"\",\r\n    description9: \"\",\r\n    description10: \"\",\r\n    description11: \"\",\r\n    description12: \"\",\r\n    description13: \"\",\r\n    description14: \"\",\r\n    coravin: false,\r\n    grapes: \"Bual\",\r\n    grape1: \"Bual\",\r\n    grape2: \"\",\r\n    grape3: \"\",\r\n    grape4: \"\",\r\n\r\n    area: \"Madeira Island\",\r\n    country: \"Portugal\",\r\n    lastUpdated: \"2019-11-19T21:56:56.931Z\",\r\n    picture: \"blandy1968\",\r\n    vinyard: \"Blandys\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    _id: \"5da7731a36ae24c5609ca4f6\",\r\n    name: \"Noval Black, Ruby Port (Keen-ta Due No-Vol)\",\r\n    year: \"NV\",\r\n    place: \"\",\r\n    appellation: \"Porto\",\r\n    funfact:\r\n      \"One of the major historic Port houses located in the classic Port growing region of the Douro valley.

We know this based on the personal records and diaries of Thomas Jefferson, written in 1780. After a long period when Chateau Kirwan was not known for producing the quality of wine the Left Bank estate was able to produce, the management hired Michel Rolland to consult the estate starting in 1991.

It usually means a Prädikatswein that is sweeter or more intense, and wine made in a very small lot.\",\r\n    timestamp: \"2019-11-20T00:01:51.102Z\",\r\n    mise: \"AP\",\r\n    lastUpdated: \"2019-11-20T00:02:02.651Z\",\r\n    color: \"white\",\r\n    status: \"none\",\r\n    picture: \"fritzhaag\",\r\n    coravin: true,\r\n    description11: \"Honey\",\r\n    description12: \"Saffron\",\r\n    description13: \"Ginger\",\r\n    description14: null,\r\n    grape2: null,\r\n    grape3: null,\r\n    grape4: null,\r\n    price: null\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    _id: \"5dd48367a479c80e1cccb311\",\r\n    vinyard: \"August Clape\",\r\n    name: \"Renaissance (August Klahp)\",\r\n    grape1: \"Syrah\",\r\n    grapes: \"Syrah\",\r\n    year: \"2014\",\r\n    area: \"Northern Rhone\",\r\n    country: \"France\",\r\n    appellation: \"Cornas\",\r\n    description1: \"Blackberry\",\r\n    description2: \"Black Plum\",\r\n    description3: \"Blueberry\",\r\n    description4: \"Olives\",\r\n    description5: \"Smoke\",\r\n    description6: \"Cured Meats\",\r\n    description7: \"Violets\",\r\n    description8: \"Tree Sap\",\r\n    description9: \"Iron\",\r\n    description10: \"Crushed Rock\",\r\n    funfact:\r\n      \"In the world of wine, there are many good winegrowers however, Auguste Clape will go down in history as one of the greats. A proud and uncompromising pioneer of fine winemaking in the Northern Rhône, his Syrahs from the cru of Cornas have earned their place among the most celebrated wines of France. The Clapes have been vignerons for many generations, but the infamous grower strikes of 1906 and 1907 forced Auguste's grandfather out of the Languedoc and into the Northern Rhône to start anew from practically nothing. The Clapes rebuilt their fortunes, terrace by terrace, along the steep, western slopes of the Rhône River. For many years, the majority of growers in Cornas sold their fruit to négociants. Auguste was the first to bottle his own wine, which eventually paved the way for such contemporary superstars as Thierry Allemand. Without pretense or fanfare, Auguste, the former mayor of Cornas, was a stately picture of grace and magnanimity—a no-nonsense wise man who never rested on his laurels and sought to better himself and his wines each year until his passing in 2018 at the age of 93. Today, his son, Pierre-Marie, and grandson, Olivier, carry on his legacy with honor and integrity. Since 1998, a second Cornas has also been bottled: Renaissance. It’s made from 20 to 25-year-old vines on the domaine’s best slopes as well as older vines from the lower slopes.\",\r\n    timestamp: \"2019-11-20T00:05:59.620Z\",\r\n    price: 39,\r\n    mise: \"BDX\",\r\n    lastUpdated: \"2019-11-20T00:06:07.190Z\",\r\n    color: \"red\",\r\n    status: \"added\",\r\n    coravin: true,\r\n    description11: null,\r\n    description12: null,\r\n    description13: null,\r\n    description14: null,\r\n    grape2: null,\r\n    grape3: null,\r\n    grape4: null,\r\n    picture: null,\r\n    place: null\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    _id: \"5dd48450a479c80e1cccb312\",\r\n    vinyard: \"Chateau de Beaucastel\",\r\n    name: \"Chateau de Beaucastel (Shat-toe de Beaw-castel)\",\r\n    grape1: \"Grenache\",\r\n    grape2: \"Mourvèdre\",\r\n    grape3:\r\n      \"Vaccarèse, Terret Noir, Muscardin, Clairette, Picpoul, Picardan, Bourboulenc, Roussanne\",\r\n    grapes:\r\n      \"30% Grenache, 30% Mourvèdre, 30% Vaccarèse, Terret Noir, Muscardin, Clairette, Picpoul, Picardan, Bourboulenc, Roussanne, 15% Syrah, 10% Counoise, 5% Cinsault \",\r\n    year: \"1998\",\r\n    area: \"Southern Rhone\",\r\n    country: \"France\",\r\n    appellation: \"Chateauneuf-du-Pape\",\r\n    description1: \"Kirsch\",\r\n    description2: \"Stewed Strawberries\",\r\n    description3: \"Garrigue\",\r\n    description4: \"Thyme\",\r\n    description5: \"Smoked Meats\",\r\n    description6: \"Mushrooms\",\r\n    description7: \"Black Tea\",\r\n    description8: \"Wet Stones\",\r\n    description9: \"River Rocks\",\r\n    description10: \"Vanilla\",\r\n    funfact:\r\n      \"The first evidence of Château de Beaucastel as it exists today is in the sixteenth century. In 1549, Pierre de Beaucastel bought a “barn with a plot of land extending to 52 saumées at Coudoulet.” The manor house was then built with the arms of Beaucastel sculpted on a stone wall of the drawing room. In 1687, de Beaucastel was appointed “Capitaine de la ville de Courthezon” by Louis XIV in recognition of his conversion to Catholicism. Louis XIV’s letter, also signed by Colbert, is still visible at the Château. In 1909, Pierre Traminer bought the estate and then transferred it to his son-in-law Pierre Perrin, a scientist who further developed Beaucastel. His son, Jacques, continued his father’s efforts until 1978 and gave its noble letters to the wine. Today, the torch is being carried by Jean-Pierre and François, Jacques’ sons. Marc, Pierre, Thomas, Cécile, Charles, Matthieu, and César, the fifth generation, work with them today. Beaucastel is, first of all, a family story, the story of Famille Perrin. Beaucastel was one of the very first domaines to practise organic viticulture - namely no use of herbicides, insecticides or any other chemicals. Unusually, all 13 permitted grape varieties are grown although it is Mourvèdre which is Beaucastel`s signature grape, often making up a third of the final blend.\",\r\n    timestamp:
